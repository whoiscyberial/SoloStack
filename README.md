# SoloStack
This website contains tools for full-cycle development of side-projects for "indiehackers". I made it in 2 weeks as a pet-project for improving my skills in web-development. I've learnt a lot about Zustand (state management tool) and why state management tools are needed in real projects. Also I got deeper understanding of React, its' rerenders and ways to escape that. This is my first project where i've used SSR and made a SEO optimization.

# Why I don't continue to work on this project
I think this is all I wanted to build within this idea. I think other functionality will be overwhelming so I don't want to continue building this project. Also I don't see a way to monetize it now so it can't be a motivation too. It was an interesting project and I'm glad I've built it with my favorite technology stack.
